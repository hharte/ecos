To build the PDF version of docs (on Linux), simply use:
make pdf

If Your pdfjadetex complains with
	> ! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [save size=5000].
then define
	save_size.pdfjadetex=10000 (at least) in
	/usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf instead of 5000.

If You don't get coloured links in Your output, or if You 
wish to modify the pdfjadetex default behaviour then add
a file named jadetex.cfg into each directory where the build
takes place and put something like that into:

\hypersetup{pdfpagemode=None,  pdfauthor=eCos (pdfjadetex) ,  colorlinks=true,
 linkcolor=blue,  pdfstartview=FitH}
