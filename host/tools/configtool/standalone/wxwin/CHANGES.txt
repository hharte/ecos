Release History for eCos Configuration Tool 2
=============================================

*** Version 2.03, June 28th 2001

- Corrected a bug introduced in the previous release, where the initial template
  selection was wrong.

*** Version 2.02, June 27th 2001

- Packages are now sorted in the Packages Dialog.
  Templates are sorted on Windows, not yet on Linux.

- There was an interaction between Configtool/TCL/Windows 98 that
  caused a GPF when saving files. This has now been worked around.

- When entering the user tools directory, Configtool now
  recognises it correctly if it contains appropriate binaries.

- The current build tools path is saved so that if the eCos
  installer wasn't used, there will be a default build tools
  path and the user won't get asked every time.

- Main window now refreshed after some dialogs close and before
  a lengthy operation for aesthetic reasons.

- The dialogs for saving and opening .ecc files now default to the
  directory of the last loaded/saved file, for convenience.

- Switched to Rich Edit control for Output Window since it has
  a higher capacity; this causes scrolling behaviour to be
  less than optimal on NT and a bit weird on Win98, so there's some
  work to do.

- Stopping a build now works.

- Added CHANGES.txt and TODO.txt to the distribution.

*** Version 2.01, June 2001

- Clicking Save when tool was first loaded didn't do anything.
  Now behaves like Save As for a first-time save.

- Mix-up with directory names fixed.

- Windows installer now leaves existing DLLs intact even if
  the installer's files were newer.

- The Unix tarball now contains a subdirectory containing the current
  version in the name.


*** Version 2.0, May 2001

- Initial public release
