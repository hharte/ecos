To-Do List for Configuration Tool 2.x
=====================================

- Implement Memory Layout Tool.

- Debug Run Tests Dialog.

- List templates in alphabetical order under Linux. Unfortunately
  wxComboBox in wxGTK doesn't support wxCB_SORT at this time
  (but wxChoice does).

- User reports that if you set ECOS_REPOSITORY to e.g. /home/julians/eCos/ecc/ecc,
  configtool will complain about a missing packages directory.
  (Can't reproduce.)

- Importing more than one package at a time can cause conflicts
  whereas importing one at a time causes no conflicts.

- Switching to Rich Edit control for Output Window causes scroll problems
  on Windows 98.
