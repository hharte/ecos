To-Do List for Configuration Tool 2.x
=====================================

- Implement Memory Layout Tool.

- Verify Run Tests Dialog works for TCP/IP mode on Linux.

- List templates in alphabetical order under Linux. Unfortunately
  wxComboBox in wxGTK doesn't support wxCB_SORT at this time
  (but wxChoice does).

- Importing more than one package at a time can cause conflicts
  whereas importing one at a time causes no conflicts.

- Switching to Rich Edit control for Output Window causes scroll problems
  on Windows 98.

- Added menu option Build | Generate Build Tree to simply recreate the
  build tree, since otherwise one sometimes has to alter a value to convince the
  tool to save and create the tree.

- Resolve target makefile problems. A user:-

  "It looks like the Configuration Tool 2.0 builds the library by replacing
  lib members, not recreating the whole library. Example situation: I want to
  remove POSIX pthread support and write my enhanced pthread_create() etc..
  If I just uncheck POSIX thread support and rebuild, the pthread functions
  remain in libtarget.a, resulting to redefinition error in my application
  link phase. Is this intended for some obvious reason?
  Now I must save to another xxx.ecc and build all."

  Bart says: "The whole makefile generation system needs a major overhaul."

- Make as many UI elements as possible copyable to the clipboard, such as the
  name and description for a configuration option. Can do this via the right-click
  menus.
