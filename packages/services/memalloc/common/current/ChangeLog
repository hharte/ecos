	* cdl/memalloc.cdl: Make dlmalloc the default malloc implementation now.
	Also add info to the variable block and dlmalloc descriptions to
	describe the pros and cons of these allocators.

2000-08-09  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* tests/malloc4.cxx (thrfree): Don't yield at loop end - actually delay
	(thrrealloc): Ditto
	(thrcalloc): Ditto
	(thrmalloc): Ditto

2000-08-08  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* tests/malloc4.cxx: Make output more frequent

2000-08-04  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* tests/dlmalloc1.cxx (STACKSIZE): Define larger than default.

2000-08-03  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* include/dlmallocimpl.hxx (class Cyg_Mempool_dlmalloc_Implementation):
	Ensure typedefs are public so dlmalloc.cxx can use them at outer level.

2000-08-02  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* src/heapgen.tcl: Fix tclsh invocation quoting problems

2000-07-31  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* src/heapgen.tcl: Allow builddir to be specified on command-line
	* cdl/memalloc.cdl: Work around NT cygtclsh80 bug by cd'ing into
	heapgen.tcl's directory before running it

2000-07-26  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* tests/malloc4.cxx: Call rand_r() rather than rand, and use a seed
	var in each thread.

2000-07-25  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* tests/malloc4.cxx (thrfree): Get mem size here. Tidy output.
	(thrmalloc): Get mem size in thrfree instead

	* src/heapgen.tcl: Refine search for user-defined name to cope with
	use of CYG_LABEL_DEFN macro

2000-07-19  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* cdl/memalloc.cdl (CYGIMP_MEMALLOC_ALLOCATOR_DLMALLOC_SAFE_MULTIPLE):
	Default to 1

	* include/mvarimpl.inl (resize_alloc): Remember to adjust other
	freelist entries when extending block

2000-07-04  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* CYGPKG_MEMALLOC:

	Created as new package, merging existing memory allocator related stuff
	from the kernel and libc. Many bug fixes to existing stuff, as
	well as performance improvements, and extra features such as
	a port of dlmalloc, and the ability to support multiple disjoint
	heaps, possibly with run-time configurable size.
	There's even a bit of documentation, and some new tests
