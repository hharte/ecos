          There are two different implementations of the counter

          table of linked lists, with the size of the table being a
          separate configurable option. For more complicated
          operations it is better to have a table of lists since this
          reduces the amount of computation whenever the timer goes
          off. Assuming a table size of 8 (the default value) on
          average the timer code will only need to check 1/8 of the

         Sorting the counter lists reduces the amount of work that

         However, it makes adding an alarm to the list more expensive
         since a search must be done for the correct place to put it.
         Many alarms are used to implement timeouts, which seldom trigger,
         so it is worthwhile optimizing this case. For this reason
         sorted list are disabled by default."
