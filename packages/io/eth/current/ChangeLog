2000-08-25  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/eth_drv_stats.h (ether_drv_stats): A little further
	diddling; have a bool to say whether the dot3 info is filled in.

2000-08-24  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/net/eth_drv.c (eth_drv_ioctl): Implement ioctl() calls.
	sockio.h numbers SIOCGIFSTATS and SIOCGIFSTATSUD map to
	ETH_DRV_GET_IF_STATS and ETH_DRV_GET_IF_STATS_UD respectively.

	* include/eth_drv.h (ETH_DRV_GET_IF_STATS_UD): Add new device
	interface ioctl() numbers, to get the struct below filled in.
	Also pull in the definition include file (below).

	* include/eth_drv_stats.h (ether_drv_stats): New file: Define
	common structure for ether devices to return stats info to higher
	up, via an ioctl() call.  SNMP uses this.

2000-08-23  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/stand_alone/eth_drv.c: 
	* include/eth_drv.h: Low level drivers now need to export a 
	function which returns the interrupt vector used by that interface.
	This allows outside code to determine this in a portable fashion.

2000-08-16  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/stand_alone/eth_drv.c: 
	* include/eth_drv.h: Clean up warnings (better protyping).

	* src/stand_alone/eth_drv.c (eth_drv_write): Abandon sending
	packet if device goes not ready for a long time (in some cases,
	this is the only indication that the link is down).

2000-08-07  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/net/eth_drv.c (eth_drv_recv): Add safety in case this gets
	called [from stand-alone code] while interface is not up.
	
	* src/stand_alone/eth_drv.c: 
	* include/eth_drv.h: Rework to more fully support mixed stand-alone
	and system (eCos) stacks.

2000-08-03  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/eth_drivers.cdl: Reparent within I/O, not NET.  This allows
	for stand-alone use as well as support for other stack implementations.

2000-07-28  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/eth_drv.c (eth_drv_recv): Assert that the length we're asked
	to deal with is at least an ether header, and also be defensive in
	any case; discard small packets.  [CASE 104206]

2000-07-26  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/eth_drv.c: 
	* include/eth_drv.h: Change interfaces used by hardware layer to
	be "soft" (pointers to functions).  This will allow those drivers
	to be shared by applications and the ROM/debug environment.

2000-07-15  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/eth_drv.h: Add [initial] extensions to let this
	layer work either in an eCos environment or stand-alone.

2000-07-11  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/eth_drv.h: Add minimal PCMCIA support.

	* src/eth_drv.c (eth_drv_netdev): New function - used to find the
	ethernet device info for PCMCIA devices.

2000-06-23  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/eth_drv.c (eth_drv_send): Do not consume an SG entry for
	zero length data; tolerate overflow of the SG.  Before this, pings
	of 6000 bytes crashed the system!

	You can now set net_debug to 2 to get quieter output; 1 gives the
	whole packet dump as before.

	* include/eth_drv.h (MAX_ETH_DRV_SG): Make this 16 so that an MTU
	made of all mbufs will not overflow.

2000-03-28  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/eth_drv.c (eth_drv_recv): Tolerate running out of MBUFs
	instead of "panic"ing.

2000-03-08  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/eth_drv.c: Add some function [block] comments.
	(eth_drv_send): Use eCos scheduler lock instead of interrupt lock.

2000-03-08  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* doc/driver_doc: Add some clarification about what's called when,
	proofreading results, shorter lines so I can print it nicely.

2000-03-06  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/eth_drv.c: 
	* include/eth_drv.h: 
	* doc/driver_doc: Remove generic "priv"ate references.

2000-02-29  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/eth_drv.c: 
	* include/eth_drv.h: New expanded API for hardware drivers.

2000-02-18  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/eth_drv.c (eth_drv_send): Disable interrupts while initiating
	the buffer send - avoid a possible race.

2000-02-08  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/eth_drivers.cdl:
	Reparent under CYGPKG_NET and tidy display strings.
