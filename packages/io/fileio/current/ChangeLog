	Added cyg_timestamp() to provide timestamp support to client
	filesystems.

2000-08-09  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* src/misc.cxx: Don't define own strcmp() function (which had a bug
	anyway). Use string.h.
	* cdl/fileio.cdl: requires ISO C string functions

2000-08-01  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* src/misc.cxx: Use correct initializer for mtab_extra

	* src/fio.h (FILEIO_RETURN_VOID): Surround in CYG_MACRO_START to
	prevent problems when used with one-line if.
	(FILEIO_RETURN_VALUE): Likewise

	* include/fileio.h: Make getinfo/setinfo take void *bufs, not char *
	for easier casting (and more correct)

	* tests/testfs.c: Likewise

	* src/devfs.cxx: Likewise.
	Also fix bug with Nick's change below that set non-blocking mode
	in all cases.

2000-07-31  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/devfs.cxx (dev_open): Added support for O_NONBLOCK.

2000-07-27  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	#ifdef CYGPKG_IO_SERIAL.

2000-07-25  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	in #ifdef TEST_NET

2000-07-25  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/select.c (main): Added call to
	init_all_network_interfaces(). 

2000-07-21  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/fileio.h:
	* src/file.cxx:
	* src/devfs.cxx:
	* tests/testfs.c:
	Added support for link() API call. This was the only major file
	operation omitted.

2000-07-20  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/fileio.h: Added some modes for fsync().

	* src/file.cxx: Added access() function.

	* src/io.cxx: Added fdatasync() and isatty().

	* src/devfs.cxx: Added fsync() support.

	* tests/fileio1.c: Added calls to access() to check (non-)existence
	of files where appropriate.

2000-07-13  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/select.cxx (select): Fixed return value when timing out. Now
	returns zero and no error, it used to return -1 and ETIMEDOUT.

	* src/io.cxx: Fixed fsync() to match standard.

	* src/devfs.cxx:
	Added lseek() support - all devices are always at position
	zero. Added [f]stat() support - currently just fills in the stat
	buffer with some predefined values. When we have more
	sophisticated devices this may need to be improved.

	* tests/testfs.c (testfs_open): Added support for O_TRUNC open
	flag.
	
	* tests/stdio.c: 
	* cdl/fileio.cdl:
	Added stdio.c to test C library IO integration. This does not test
	the C library functionality, just that it works with the fileio
	package in certain limited ways.

2000-06-30  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/misc.cxx: Fixed definition of mtab_extra[] so that it gets
	emitted correctly into the object file.

	* tests/testfs.c:
	Added support for dynamic mount()/umount().
	Added testfs_dump() to report state of filesystem, and to do a
	little consistency checking.

	* tests/fileio1.c: Extended testing to mount() and maximum file
	sizes.

2000-06-28  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/dirent.h: Added this file to contain directory support
	definitions.

	* include/fileio.h:
	Introduced separate typedefs for all operation functions.
	Added CYG_FDIR to mark directory streams.
	Added some default operation functions.

	* src/fio.h (FILEIO_RETURN_VOID): Added this macro.

	* src/dir.cxx: Added this file to contain directory listing API
	functions.

	* src/misc.cxx:
	Added default operation functions.

	* src/file.cxx:
	Fixed mkdir() to have correct prototype.
	Moved opendir() to dir.cxx.
	Added support in chdir() for deregistering the current directory.

	* cdl/fileio.cdl: Added dev.cxx to compile list. Added support for
	dirent.h implementation.

	* tests/testfs.c: Lots of changes towards a more complete
	implementation.

	* tests/select.c: Changed SHOW_RESULT() message a little. Fixed up
	some warnings when no testing is possible.

	* tests/fileio1.c:
	Largely rewritten to do more complete testing.

2000-06-19  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/select.cxx: Added selwake_count variable to count select
	wakeups. This allows us to avoid sleeping when a selectee calls
	cyg_selwakeup() while we are still scanning the FD sets.

	* include/fileio.h:
	* include/sockio.h: 
	* src/misc.cxx: 
	* src/socket.cxx: 
	Converted tables to new mechanism.

	* tests/select.c: Reduced buffer size to avoid buffer overflow in
	serial devices. 
	
2000-06-15  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/fileio.h:
	Added typedef for cyg_selinfo.
	Added umount to fstab entry structure.
	Added mount() and unmount() prototypes.
	Added const in various places.
	Changed some types from CYG_ADDRWORD to their ISO standard
	equivalents.
	Added si_thread field to cyg_selinfo structure, added
	cyg_selinit() prototype.

	* src/socket.cxx: Converted an errant LOCK_NS() into the
	UNLOCK_NS() it should be.

	* src/select.cxx:
	Added cyg_selinit() which must be called by all selectees at
	initialization to prepare a cyg_selinfo structure for use.
	Modified cyg_selwakeup() to minimize the number for actual wakeup
	operations it actually performs.

	* src/misc.cxx:
	Added mtab_extra[] to contain dynamic mount table entries,
	modified startup scan of mtab to cope with this.
	changed matchlen() to cope with "/" mountpoint, this function is
	rapidly ceasing to be the neat bit of code it started out as.
	Added implementations of mount() and umount().

	* src/devfs.cxx: Added dev_umount, various minor tweaks.

	* cdl/fileio.cdl: Added CYGNUM_FILEIO_MTAB_EXTRA to define how
	many extra mount table entries should exist for dynamic mounts.
	Added select.c to list of tests.

	* tests/select.c: Added this file to test select() functionality
	on both sockets and (serial) devices.

	* tests/socket.c: Tidied some compilation warnings.

	* tests/testfs.c: Added umount stub function.
	
2000-06-12  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/sockio.h: 
	* include/fileio.h:
	* src/fio.h: 
	* tests/testfs.c: 
	* src/socket.cxx: 
	* src/misc.cxx: 
	* src/file.cxx: 
	* src/fd.cxx: 
	* src/io.cxx: 
	* src/devfs.cxx: 
	Tidied up and sorted out locking protocols and synchronization
	mechanisms.

2000-06-09  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/select.cxx: 
	* src/devfs.cxx: 
	* include/fileio.h:
	* tests/testfs.c: 
	Added select() support.

	* src/socket.cxx: Fixed a resource management bug in accept().

	* tests/socket.c: Extended to test that all API calls work, at
	least minimally, as they should. Still some calls to add here.
	
2000-06-07  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/socket.c: Simple socket API test program. Needs much more
	work to give full coverage.

	* src/socket.cxx: Filled in some implementations. Changed some
	type specifications.

	* src/select.cxx: Added this file to contain select()
	implementation. At present it does nothing.

	* include/sockio.h:
	Added definition of socklen_t for use when the NET package is
	absent - just so this file compiles.
	Added macro to generate an nstab entry.
	Changed prototypes of socket operation ffunctions to better match
	both API definition and BSD stack implementation.

	* cdl/fileio.cdl: Added support for socket API. This is only
	active if the NET package is present.
	Added initial socket API test program.

2000-06-02  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/socket.cxx:
	Added this file to implement socket interface. This is still a
	rough draft that has not yet been tested.

	* src/misc.cxx: 
	* src/io.cxx: 
	* src/fio.h: Various minor changes and bug fixes.

	* src/file.cxx: Various bug fixes. Added pathconf().

	* src/fd.cxx: Various changes and bug fixes, mostly in the
	handling of the locking mechanisms.

	* src/devfs.cxx: Added this filesystem to interface to the device
	IO subsystem. Not yet tested.

	* include/sockio.h: Various minor changes prompted by
	implementation.

	* include/fileio.h:
	Added macros to instantiate filesystem and mount table entries.
	Added mode mask for setting up f_flags.
	Changed file object types, added device type.

	* cdl/fileio.cdl:
	Added some extra files to compile. Some now go in libextras.
	Added table maxima for fstab, mtab and nstab.
	Added tests.

	* tests/fileio1.c: Added this simple test for the fileio
	infrastructure.

	* tests/testfs.c:
	Created this simple ROM filesystem to test out the fileio
	infrastructure. This is not really usable for anything other than
	this, and should not be used in "production" systems. Hence its
	presence in tests rather than src.
	At present this only has support for open(), close(), read(),
	write(), lseek() and unlink(). Other parts will be implemented as
	and when required.
	
2000-05-31  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/fio.h: 
	* src/file.cxx: 
	* src/io.cxx: 
	* src/misc.cxx:
	Roughed out most of the file IO infrastructure. While this code
	compiles, none of it has actually been executed yet. A lot of this
	was cut-and-paste-and-edit, so some minor blemishes are to be
	expected.

	* src/fd.cxx: Several modifications in response to implementing
	rest of infrastructure. Added dup() and dup2() API routines.

	* include/fileio.h: Many changes and tidies prompted by
	infrastructure implementation.

	* cdl/fileio.cdl: Added "implements" directives for isoinfra
	interfaces. Extended compile to new files.

2000-05-26  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/fileio.h:
	* include/sockio.h:
	* src/fd.cxx:
	* cdl/fileio.cdl: 
	Created these files as a start at defining the file IO package.
	There is still a lot to do here, so expect radical changes to all
	of these files in the near future.
