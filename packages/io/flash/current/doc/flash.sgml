<TITLE>The eCos FLASH Library</TITLE>
<PARA>The FLASH library is an optional part of eCos, and is only
	applicable to some platforms.</PARA>
<PARA>The eCos FLASH library provides the following functionality:</PARA>

<PARA> There are two APIs with the flash library. The old API is
retained for backwards compatibility reasons, but should slowly be
replaced with the new API which is much more flexible and does not

<SECT1>
<TITLE>Notes on using the FLASH library</TITLE>

<PARA>FLASH devices cannot be read from when an erase or write
operation is active. This means it is not possible to execute code
from flash while an erase or write operation is active. It is possible
to use the library when the executable image is resident in FLASH. The
low level drivers are written such that the linker places the
functions that actually manipulate the flash into RAM.  However the
library may not be interrupt safe. An interrupt must not cause
execution of code that is resident in FLASH. This may be the image
itself, or RedBoot. In some configurations of eCos, ^C on the serial
port or debugging via Ethernet may cause an interrupt handler to call
RedBoot. If RedBoot is resident in FLASH this will cause a crash.
Similarly, if another thread invokes a virtual vector function to
access RedBoot, eg to perform a <FUNCTION>diag_printf()</FUNCTION> a
crash could result.
</PARA>

<PARA> Thus with a ROM based image or a ROM based Redboot it is
recommended to disable interrupts while erasing or programming
flash. Using both a ROMRAM or RAM images and a ROMRAM or RAM RedBoot
are safe and there is no need to disable interrupts. Similarly,

<TITLE>Danger, Will Robinson! Danger!</TITLE>

<PARA>Unlike nearly every other aspect of embedded system programming,
getting it wrong with FLASH devices can render your target system
useless. Most targets have a boot loader in the FLASH. Without this
boot loader the target will obviously not boot. So before starting to
play with this library its worth investigating a few things. How do
you recover your target if you delete the boot loader? Do you have the
necessary JTAG cable? Or is specialist hardware needed? Is it even
possible to recover the target boards or must it be thrown into the
rubbish bin? How does killing the board affect your project schedule?

<TITLE>The Version 2 eCos FLASH API</TITLE>

<PARA> There are two APIs described here. The first is the application
API which programs should use. The second API is that between the
FLASH IO library and the device drivers. </PARA>

<SECT1 id="ecos-flash-v2-api">
<TITLE>FLASH user API</TITLE>
<PARA> 

<PARA>All of the functions described below are declared in the header
file <filename>&lt;cyg/io/flash.h.h&gt;</filename> which all users of

<SECT2>
<TITLE>Initializing the FLASH library</TITLE>

<PARA>The FLASH library needs to be initialized before other FLASH
operations can be performed. This only needs to be done once. The
following function will only do the initialization once so it's safe
to call multiple times: </PARA>

<PROGRAMLISTING>__externC int cyg_flash_init(const cyg_flash_printf *pf); 
typedef int cyg_flash__printf(const char *fmt, ...); </PROGRAMLISTING>

<PARA>
The parameter <parameter>pf</parameter> is a pointer to a function
which is to be used for diagnostic output. Typically the function
<function>diag_printf()</function> will be passed. Normally this
function is not used by the higher layer of the library unless
<literal>CYGSEM_IO_FLASH_CHATTER</literal> is enabled.  Passing a
<parameter>NULL</parameter> is not recommended, even when
CYGSEM_IO_FLASH_CHATTER is disabled. The lower layers of the library
may unconditionally call this function, especially when errors occur,
probably resulting in a more serious error/crash!.</PARA>

<TITLE>Retrieving information about FLASH devices</TITLE> 

<PARA>
The following five functions return information about the FLASH.
</PARA>

<PROGRAMLISTING>
__externC int cyg_flash_get_info(cyg_uint32 devno, cyg_flash_info_t * info);
__externC int cyg_flash_get_info_addr(cyg_flashaddr_t flash_base, cyg_flash_info_t * info);

<PARA><FUNCTION>cyg_flash_get_info()</FUNCTION> is the main function
to get information about installed flash devices.  Parameter
<PARAMETER>devno</PARAMETER> is used to iterate over the available
flash devices, starting from 0. If the devno'th device exists, the
structure pointed to by <PARAMETER>info</PARAMETER> is filled in and
<LITERAL>CYG_FLASH_ERR_OK</LITERAL> is returned, otherwise
<LITERAL>CYG_FLASH_ERR_INVALID</LITERAL>.
<FUNCTION>cyg_flash_get_info()</FUNCTION> if similar, but returns the
information about the flash device at the given address.
<FUNCTION>cyg_flash_block_size()</FUNCTION> returns the size of the
block at the given address.  <FUNCTION>cyg_flash_verify_addr()

devices, returning <LITERAL>CYG_FLASH_ERR_OK </LITERAL> if so.

<TITLE>Reading from FLASH</TITLE>

<PARA>
There are two methods for reading from FLASH. The first is to use the
following function. </PARA>

<PROGRAMLISTING>
__externC int cyg_flash_read(flashaddr_t *flash_base, const void *ram_base, const size_t len, flashaddr_t **err_address);
</PROGRAMLISTING>

<PARA>
<PARAMETER>flash_base</PARAMETER> is where in the flash to read
from. <PARAMETER>ram_base</PARAMETER> indicates where the data read
from flash should be placed into RAM. <PARAMETER>len</PARAMETER> is
the number of bytes to be read from the FLASH and
<PARAMETER>err_address</PARAMETER> is used to return the location in
FLASH that any error occurred while reading.
</PARA>

<PARA>
The second method is to simply <FUNCTION>memcpy()</FUNCTION> directly
from the FLASH. This is not recommended since some types of device
cannot be read in this way, eg NAND FLASH. Using the FLASH library
function to read the FLASH will always work so making it easy to port
code from one FLASH device to another.

<TITLE>Erasing areas of FLASH</TITLE>

<PARA>
Blocks of FLASH can be erased using the following function:
</PARA>

<PROGRAMLISTING>__externC int cyg_flash_erase(flashaddr_t *flash_base, const size_t len, flashaddr_t **err_address);
</PROGRAMLISTING>

<PARA>
<PARAMETER>flash_base</PARAMETER> is where in the flash to erase
from. <PARAMETER>len</PARAMETER> is the minimum number of bytes to
erase in the FLASH and <PARAMETER>err_address</PARAMETER> is used to
return the location in FLASH that any error occurred while erasing. It
should be noted that FLASH devices are block oriented when erasing. It
is not possible to erase a few bytes within a block, the whole block
will be erased. <PARAMETER>flash_base</PARAMETER> may be anywhere
within the first block to be erased and <PARAMETER>flash_base+len

<TITLE>Locking and unlocking blocks</TITLE>

<PARA>
Some flash devices have the ability to lock and unlock blocks. A
locked block cannot be erased or programmed without it first being
unlocked. For devices which support this feature and when <LITERAL>
CYGHWR_IO_FLASH_BLOCK_LOCKING</LITERAL> is enabled then the following
two functions are available:</PARA>

<PROGRAMLISTING>
__externC int cyg_flash_lock(const flashaddr_t *flash_base, const size_t len, flashaddr_t **err_address);
__externC int cyg_flash_unlock(const flashaddr_t *flash_base, const size_t len, flashaddr_t **err_address);
</PROGRAMLISTING>

</SECT2>

<SECT2>
<TITLE>Locking FLASH Mutex's</TITLE>

<PARA>When the eCos kernel package is included in the eCos
configuration, the FLASH IO library will perform mutex locking on
FLASH operations. This makes the API defined here thread safe. However
applications may wish to directly access the contents of the FLASH. In
order for this to be thread safe it is necessary for the application
to use the following two functions to inform the FLASH IO library that
the FLASH devices are being used and other API calls should be
blocked.</PARA>

<PROGRAMLISTING>
__externC int cyg_flash_mutex_lock(const flashaddr_t *from, const size_t len);
__externC int cyg_flash_mutex_unlock(const flashaddr_t *from, const size_t len);

<TITLE>Return values and errors</TITLE>

<PARA>All the functions above return one of the following return
values.</PARA>

CYG_FLASH_ERR_OK              No error - operation complete
CYG_FLASH_ERR_INVALID         Invalid FLASH address

<PARA>block_mask is used internally in the FLASH IO library. It
contains a mask which can be used to turn an arbitrary address in
flash to the base address of the block which contains the
address.</PARA>

<PARA>There exists one global instance of this structure with the name
<parameter>flash_info</parameter>. All calls into the device driver
makes use of this global structure to maintain state.</PARA>

<TITLE>Initializing the device driver</TITLE>

<PARA>The FLASH IO library will call the following function to
initialize the device driver:</PARA>

<PROGRAMLISTING>externC int  flash_hwr_init(void);
</PROGRAMLISTING>

<PARA>The device driver should probe the hardware to see if the FLASH
devices exist. If it does it should fill in <parameter>start, end,
blocks and block_size.</parameter>If the FLASH contains a write buffer
the size of this should be placed in <parameter>buffer_size
</parameter>. On successful probing the function should return
<literal>FLASH_ERR_OK</literal>. When things go wrong it can be
assumed that <parameter>pf</parameter> points to a printf like
function for outputting error messages.

<TITLE>Querying the FLASH</TITLE>

<PARA>FLASH devices can be queried to return there manufacture ID,
size etc. This function allows this information to be returned.</PARA>

<PROGRAMLISTING>int flash_query(unsigned char *data);</PROGRAMLISTING>

<PARA>The caller must know the size of data to be returned and provide
an appropriately sized buffer pointed to be parameter

<TITLE>Erasing a block of FLASH</TITLE>

<PARA>So that the FLASH IO layer can erase a block of FLASH the
following function should be provided.</PARA>

<PROGRAMLISTING>int flash_erase_block(volatile flash_t *block, unsigned int block_size);
</PROGRAMLISTING>

</SECT2>
<SECT2>
<TITLE>Programming a region of FLASH</TITLE>

<PARA>The following function must be provided so that data can be
written into the FLASH.</PARA>

<PROGRAMLISTING>int flash_program_buf(volatile flash_t *addr, flash_t *data, int len,
                  unsigned long block_mask, int buffer_size);</PROGRAMLISTING>

<PARA>The device will only be asked to program data in one block of
the flash. The FLASH IO layer will break longer user requests into a
smaller writes.</PARA>

<SECT2>
<TITLE>Reading a region from FLASH</TITLE>

<PARA>Some FLASH devices are not memory mapped so it is not possible
to read there contents directly. The following function read a region
of FLASH.</PARA>

<PROGRAMLISTING>int flash_read_buf(volatile flash_t* addr, flash_t* data, int len);
</PROGRAMLISTING>

<PARA>As with writing to the flash, the FLASH IO layer will break
longer user requests for data into a number of reads which are at
maximum one block in size.</PARA>

<PARA>A device which cannot be read directy should set
<LITERAL>CYGSEM_IO_FLASH_READ_INDIRECT</LITERAL> so that the IO layer
makes use of the <function>flash_read_buf()</function>function.

</SECT2> 

<SECT2>
<TITLE>Locking and unlocking FLASH blocks</TITLE>

<PARA>Some flash devices allow blocks to be locked so that they cannot
be written to. The device driver should provide the following
functions to manipulate these locks.</PARA>

<PROGRAMLISTING>int flash_lock_block(volatile flash_t *block);
int flash_unlock_block(volatile flash_t *block, int block_size, int blocks);
</PROGRAMLISTING>

<PARA>These functions are only used if
<LITERAL>CYGHWR_IO_FLASH_BLOCK_LOCKING</LITERAL></PARA>

<TITLE>Mapping FLASH error codes to FLASH IO error codes</TITLE>

<PARA>The functions <function>flash_erase_block(),
flash_program_buf(), flash_read_buf(), flash_lock_block() and
flash_unlock_block()</function> return an error code which is specific
to the flash device. To map this into a FLASH IO error code, the
driver should provide the following function: </PARA>

<PROGRAMLISTING>int flash_hwr_map_error(int err);</PROGRAMLISTING>

</SECT2>

<SECT2>
<TITLE>Determining if code is in FLASH</TITLE>

<PARA>Although a general function, the device driver is expected to
provide the implementation of the function
<function>flash_code_overlaps()</function>.</PARA>

</SECT2>

<SECT2>
<TITLE>Implementation Notes</TITLE>

<PARA>The FLASH IO layer will manipulate the caches as required. The
device drivers do not need to enable/disable caches when performing
operations of the FLASH.<PARA>

<PARA>Device drivers should keep all chatter to a minimum when
<literal>CYGSEM_IO_FLASH_CHATTER</literal> is not defined. All output
should use the print function in the <parameter>pf</parameter> in
<parameter>flash_info</parameter> and not
<function>diag_printf()</function></PARA>

<PARA>Device driver functions which manipulate the state of the flash
so that it cannot be read from for program execute need to ensure
there code is placed into RAM. The linker will do this if the
appropriate attribute is added to the function. e.g:</PARA>

<PROGRAMLISTING>int flash_program_buf(volatile flash_t *addr, flash_t *data, int len,
                  unsigned long block_mask, int buffer_size)
 __attribute__ ((section (".2ram.flash_program_buf")));</PROGRAMLISTING>
