2000-12-06  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/flash.c (flash_dev_query): Added. Allows reloc/cache magic
	to be removed from device drivers (eventually). Also fixed some
	warnings, and made function references use char[] instead of just
	char to prevent MIPS compiler from messing up.

	* include/flash.h: Added FLASH_ERR_DRV_VERIFY and flash_dev_query.

2000-11-27  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/flash.c: Do all flash access inside properly
	cache-controlled region.
	* include/flash.h: Cache definitions.

2000-11-17  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/flash.c: Added debug mode, allowing device driver to use printf.

2000-11-16  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/flash.c: Added suspend error messages.
	* include/flash.h: Same.

2000-09-01  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/flash.h: 
	* src/flash.c: CYGHWR_IO_FLASH_BLOCK_LOCKING is an interface, so
	it's always defined; look for > 0 instead.

2000-08-28  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/flash.c: 
	* include/flash.h: 
	* cdl/io_flash.cdl: Support block locking (optional by hardware).

2000-08-22  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/flash.c (flash_program): Add HAL_ICACHE_DISABLE/ENABLE pairs
	around calls to RAM copy of programming/erasing function - this is
	necessary to get reliable operation on EBSA285 and similar.
	Otherwise, what is in the instruction cache might be run instead.

2000-08-14  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/flash.h: Add block size mask for finding block boundaries.

	* src/flash.c: Use block size properly.

2000-07-29  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/flash.h: 
	* src/flash.c (flash_get_block_info): New function.
	(flash_program): Program in block_size chunks as much as possible.
