	* host/linux/ecos_usbserial.c (ecos_usbserial_probe): fix compiling
	on older kernels.

2008-07-13  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* host/linux/ecos_usbserial.c (ecos_usbserial_probe): new probe
	function so that we ignore the ACM interface, otherwise we end up
	with a useless /dev/ttyUSB device. Also allow to compile with
	kernel 2.6.26-rc9.
