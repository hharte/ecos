2001-03-13  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/ser_generic_16x5x.cdl: Rename 
	CYGPKG_IO_SERIAL_GENERIC_16X5X_FIFO_OPTIONS to
	CYGPKG_IO_SERIAL_GENERIC_16X5X_FIFO and make it a boolean. Clarify
	descriptions a little.

	* src/ser_16x5x.c (serial_config_port): Only program FCR if FIFO
	support requested.
	Don't bother with intermediate _fifo_thresh.
	Detabify.

2001-03-13  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/ser_generic_16x5x.cdl: Removed the default value.

2001-03-09  Julian Smart  <julians@redhat.com>
	Removed default value for flavor none in
	CYGPKG_IO_SERIAL_GENERIC_16X5X_FIFO_OPTIONS since it
	causes an assert in libcdl

2001-03-05  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>
	2001-02-15  Dave Airlie <airlied@parthus.com>

        * src/ser_16x5x.c (serial_config_port): Add support for setting
        a FIFO RX Threshold via CDL

        * cdl/ser_generic_16x5x.cdl: Add support for setting a FIFO
          RX threshold via CDL

2001-01-24  Dave Airlie  <airlied@parthus.com>

	* src/ser_16x5x.c (pc_serial_DSR): Allow RX timeouts to be interpreted
	as RXs.

2000-12-19   Dave Airlie <airlied@parthus.com>

	* src/ser_16x5x.c: Add defines for FIFO control register
	(serial_config_port): Use these defines.

2000-12-07  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/ser_16x5x.c (ISR_LS): Corrected value. Spotted by Dave Airlie.

2000-09-18  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/ser_16x5x.c: Allow clients to specify register
	stepping. Rename a type. Fix compile error.

2000-09-14  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/ser_16x5x.c: Moved ARM/PID driver to provide generic 16x5x
	driver. Rewritten to use HAL IO macros. Still needs some polish
	and configury to properly support all the various target
	controllers that may only have a partial set of the features.  
	* cdl/ser_generic_16x5x.cdl: Same.

	* Removed non-PID related ChangeLog entries.
	
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2000-08-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* src/pid_serial_with_ints.c (pid_serial_DSR): Remove accidental
	OVERRUNERR check duplication

2000-08-01  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* src/pid_serial_with_ints.c: Throughout, add support for line status
	and modem status callbacks, hardware RTS/CTS and DSR/DTR flow control
	(pid_serial_set_config): Now use keys to make
	more flexible.

	* src/pid_serial.h: Add more line status, interrupt status and modem
	status register definitions

	* cdl/ser_arm_pid.cdl: Implements flow control and line status
	interfaces

2000-06-22  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/<yournamehere>.cdl: Remove the comment on the empty
	include_files directive; the tools now support this correctly.
	This keeps internal include files internal.

2000-06-09  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/pid_serial_with_ints.c: 
	* src/pid_serial.h: 
	Cleaned up defines and made DSR handle all received characters.
	(Dave Airlie (airlied at parthus dot com))

2000-04-11  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/ser_arm_pid.cdl: Change the parent from CYGPKG_IO_SERIAL
	(which is enabled most of the time) to CYGPKG_IO_SERIAL_DEVICES
	(which is not...) thus allowing convenient control independent of
	platform.  Also enable all individual devices by default, now, so
	that they can be enabled simply by enabling the above new parent.

2000-04-07  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* ecos.db: Re-organize device packages.  This is a massive change
	involving deleting all the sources for serial and ethernet drivers
	from where they used to live in
	    packages/io/serial/current/src/ARCH/PLATFORM.[ch]
	    packages/net/drivers/eth/PLATFORM/current/src/...
	and reinstating them in
	    packages/devs/serial/ARCH/PLATFORM/current/src/...
	    packages/devs/eth/ARCH/PLATFORM/current/src/...

	All these new packages are properly defined in ecos.db, and are
	all of type "hardware" so that a "target" can grab them.
	
	This directory layout is descriptive of the devices we have right
	now, arch and platform are separate levels just to make it easier
	to navigate in the filesystem and similar to the HAL structure in
	the filesystem.

	It is *not* prescriptive of future work; for example, the mythical
	common highly-portable 16550 serial driver which works on many
	targets would be called "devs/serial/s16550/current", or a serial
	device for a particular board (cogent springs to mind) that can
	work with different CPUs fitted is "devs/serial/cogent/current".

	Changelogs have been preserved and replicated over all the new
	packages, so that no history is lost.

	The contents of individual source files are unchanged; they build
	in just the same emvironment except for a very few cases where the
	config file name changed in this movement.

	Targets in ecos.db have been redefined to bring in all relevant
	hardware packages including net and serial drivers (but the newly
	included packages are only active if their desired parent is
	available.)
	
	The names of CDL options (and their #defines of course) stay the
	same for the serial drivers, for backward compatibility.

	* templates/*/current.ect: these have had CYGPKG_IO_SERIAL added
	rather than it being in (almost) all target definitions.
