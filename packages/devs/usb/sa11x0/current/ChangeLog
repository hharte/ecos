2001-02-02  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* cdl/usbs_sa11x0.cdl:
	Add doc property to the html

	* doc/usbs_sa11x0.sgml, devs-usbs-sa11x0.html:
	Incorporate changes from docs department, regenerate html

2001-01-25  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* src/usbs_sa11x0_data.cxx:
	* cdl/usbs_sa11x0.cdl:
	Devtab entries were never actually being built - and did not
	build... 

	* cdl/usbs_sa11x0.cdl:
	Sort out the dependencies for minimal environments such as
	RedBoot. 

2001-01-24  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* src/usbs_sa11x0.c:
	Invoke additional platform-specific initialization, if defined
	via <cyg/hal/hal_io.h> and CYGBLD_HAL_PLATFORM_IO_H

2001-01-22  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* doc/usbs_sa11x0.sgml, doc/makefile:
	Added documentation.

2001-01-16  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* src/usbs_sa11x0.c:
	Make sure that the resume interrupt source is enabled,
	even when the USB bus is not suspended. For some reason
	this makes it possible to disconnect and reconnect.
	
2001-01-16  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* src/usbs_sa11x0.c:
	Use the HAL macros for virtual->physical address translation
	Update poll() and start() to match the documentation
	Fix the handling of control messages affecting endpoints 1 and 2
	if those endpoints are not currently configured.


2001-01-02  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* src/usbs_sa11x0.c:
	Change ep2_tx_packet() to start the DMA operation after the
	UDC packet-complete bit has been set. This avoids a very high
	error rate. Add some scheduler locking to eliminate a resulting
	race condition, and sort out the error handling to match.
	Comment out some assertions relating to spurious interrupts, which
	have been observed. Instead the code now recovers from these.

2000-12-15  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* src/usbs_sa11x0.c:
	Add debug code for tracking stats and simulating failures.
	Change the EP1 code to switch between DMA channels A and B as
	required, rather than always using channel A. This is more robust
	and was needed for the failure simulation.
	
	Make the ep1 packet processing code robust in case an unexpected
	failure occurs during its invocation. It is not clear how this
	can ever happen, but on a couple of occasions it did and caused an
	infinite loop.

2000-11-30  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* src/usbs_sa11x0.c:
	Fix DMA_CONTROL_CLEAR_ALL constant, it was ignoring START_B
	In ep2_init(), separate out the fifo write and the IN_SIZE
	write to avoid a hardware problem.

2000-11-29  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* src/usbs_sa11x0.c:
	Disable some debugging features and add retries when manipulating
	certain DMA registers - needed with some Silicon revisions.

2000-11-28  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* src/usbs_sa11x0.c:
	More rewriting, plus implementing the endpoint halt support.

2000-11-24  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* src/usbs_sa11x0.c:
	Clean up some of the debugging.
	Largely rewrite the endpoint 2 support to try and get it working
	Transmit a runt packet during initialization to work around
	hardware problem.

2000-11-22  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* include/usbs_sa11x0.h: Fix nested #include protection

2000-11-21  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* First check-in of eCos USB support.
