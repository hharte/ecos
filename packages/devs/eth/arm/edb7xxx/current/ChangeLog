	* src/if_edb7xxx.c (edb7xxx_cs8900_init): Work with new fast net
	thread to do all the copying work instead of loading up DSR time.
	In detail:
	 o New "deliver" function in the interface record.
	 o The DSR changed to be that new function; its arg is now the sc
	   pointer already, no cast needed.
	 o In creating the interrupt, use eth_drv_dsr (from the logical
	   driver) instead of cs8900_dsr (which is gone).

2000-08-23  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/if_edb7xxx.c: Add new function which returns the interrupt
	vector used by a particular interface.

2000-08-21  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/edb7xxx_eth_drivers.cdl: Add configury to set ESA.

	* src/if_edb7xxx.c: Hardware address can come from various
	sources, not just hardwired.	

2000-08-16  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/if_edb7xxx.c (cs8900_can_send): Can only send if the link
	is OK.  If the link is bad, the chip just stops...

2000-08-14  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/if_edb7xxx.c: Changes to support stand-alone usage.

2000-08-03  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/edb7xxx_eth_drivers.cdl: Ethernet driver package hierarchy changed.

2000-07-26  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/if_edb7xxx.c: Update for new eth_drv interfaces.

2000-06-22  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/<yournamehere>.cdl: Remove the comment on the empty
	include_files directive; the tools now support this correctly.
	This keeps internal include files internal.

2000-04-07  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* ecos.db: Re-organize device packages.  This is a massive change
	involving deleting all the sources for serial and ethernet drivers
	from where they used to live in
	    packages/io/serial/current/src/ARCH/PLATFORM.[ch]
	    packages/net/drivers/eth/PLATFORM/current/src/...
	and reinstating them in
	    packages/devs/serial/ARCH/PLATFORM/current/src/...
	    packages/devs/eth/ARCH/PLATFORM/current/src/...

	All these new packages are properly defined in ecos.db, and are
	all of type "hardware" so that a "target" can grab them.
	
	This directory layout is descriptive of the devices we have right
	now, arch and platform are separate levels just to make it easier
	to navigate in the filesystem and similar to the HAL structure in
	the filesystem.

	It is *not* prescriptive of future work; for example, the mythical
	common highly-portable 16550 serial driver which works on many
	targets would be called "devs/serial/s16550/current", or a serial
	device for a particular board (cogent springs to mind) that can
	work with different CPUs fitted is "devs/serial/cogent/current".

	Changelogs have been preserved and replicated over all the new
	packages, so that no history is lost.

	The contents of individual source files are unchanged; they build
	in just the same emvironment except for a very few cases where the
	config file name changed in this movement.

	Targets in ecos.db have been redefined to bring in all relevant
	hardware packages including net and serial drivers (but the newly
	included packages are only active if their desired parent is
	available.)
	
	The names of CDL options (and their #defines of course) stay the
	same for the serial drivers, for backward compatibility.

	* templates/*/current.ect: these have had CYGPKG_IO_SERIAL added
	rather than it being in (almost) all target definitions.
	
2000-03-28  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/if_edb7xxx.c (cs8900_recv): Handle case where there were
	no buffers (and thus the sg_list[] has NULL pointers).

2000-03-06  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/if_edb7xxx.c: Use new driver API.

2000-02-29  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/if_edb7xxx.c: Support new API - hardware support of 'ioctl'
	and tagged output.

2000-02-14  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/edb7xxx_eth_drivers.cdl: Add CDL magic to indicate availability
	of 'eth0' interface.

2000-02-09  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/edb7xxx_eth_drivers.cdl: Rename CDL file.

2000-02-08  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/eth_drivers.cdl:

	Tidy display strings.
