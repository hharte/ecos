	Delay more when writing/reading eeprom (200 us isn't enough).
	(phy_init): Turn on PHY before writing PHY registers.  Wait for
	auto negotiation to be complete.
	(dm9000_send): Correctly write last words to Tx SRAM when using a
	8/16 bit device.  Clarify and comment code.
	(dm9000_poll): Parse Rx packet header correctly on 8/16 bit
	devices.
	(dm9000_ioctl): Handle ETH_DRV_GET_MAC_ADDRESS and
	ETH_DRV_SET_MAC_ADDRESS.

	* cdl/davicom_dm9000_eth_drivers.cdl: New option
