	* cdl/can_mcf52xx.cdl Added two interfaces
	CYGINT_DEVS_CAN_MCF52xx_FLEXCAN_SUPP_STD_CAN_ID and
	CYGINT_DEVS_CAN_MCF52xx_FLEXCAN_SUPP_EXT_CAN_ID.
	The number of standard and extended message boxes is now
	configurable:
	CYGNUM_DEVS_CAN_MCF52xx_FLEXCAN[set ::flexcan]_STD_MBOXES
	CYGNUM_DEVS_CAN_MCF52xx_FLEXCAN[set ::flexcan]_EXT_MBOXES
	Channged default TX buffer to 15.

	* src/can_mcf52xx.c Added initialisation macro for second
	FlexCAN modul. Driver partly rewritten - support of up to
	15 message buffers when reception of all CAN frames is
	configured - improves performance when "bursts" of CAN
	messages arrive. Changed message buffer configuration -
	only the config key CYG_IO_SET_CONFIG_CAN_MSGBUF is
	supported now. The exact configuration option is defined
	in new data field cyg_can_msgbuf_cfg_id in cyg_can_msgbuf_cfg
	structure.

	* tests/flexcan_filter.c
	* tests/flexcan_wake.c
	* tests/flexcan_remote.c
	* tests/flexcan_load.c
	Changed message buffer configuration to support of new
	config key CYG_IO_SET_CONFIG_CAN_MSGBUF. Removed baudrate
	runtime configuration of 250 kBaud - now default
	value is used.

	* src/can_mcf52xx.c Only support events of tx message buffers
          in flexcan_getevent() if CYGOPT_IO_CAN_TX_EVENT_SUPPORT is
          active.

	* cdl/can_mcf52xx.cdl Default message buffer configuration 
	  changed. Message buffer 13 now is transmit message buffer.
	  Message buffers 14 and 15 are no receive message buffers
	  for all standard and extended frames.
	  
	* src/can_mcf52xx.c Driver partly rewritten. Support for message 
	  filtering added. Message buffer handling added. Several bugs 
	  fixed. Support added for configuration options
	  CYG_IO_SET_CONFIG_CAN_REMOTE_BUF
	  CYG_IO_SET_CONFIG_CAN_FILTER_MSG
	  CYG_IO_SET_CONFIG_CAN_FILTER_ALL
	  CYG_IO_SET_CONFIG_CAN_MODE
	  CYG_IO_GET_CONFIG_CAN_STATE
	  CYG_IO_GET_CONFIG_CAN_MSGBUF_INFO
	  CYG_IO_GET_CONFIG_CAN_HDI
	  
	* tests/flexcan_filter.c Test of message filtering addded
	* tests/flexcan_wake.c Test of mode setting and standby mode of
	  FlexCAN module added.
