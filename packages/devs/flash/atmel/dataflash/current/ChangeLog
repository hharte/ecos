	* cdl/devs_flash_atmel_dataflash.cdl: data flash requires indirect
	read support in the main flash code.

2004-10-07  Savin Zlobec  <savin@elatec.si> 

        * include/dataflash.h:
        * src/devs_flash_atmel_dataflash.c:
        Changed the API to be more consistent, included error
        reporting and added blocking/non blocking mode of operation.
        * src/devs_flash_atmel_dataflash_flash_dev_funs.c:
        Synced with new API and set the block size to DataFlash's
        native page size.

	* cdl/devs_flash_atmel_dataflash.cdl: Remove
	CYGSEM_IO_FLASH_READ_INDIRECT which only legacy drivers should use
	when they provide a flash_read_buf function. For V2 drivers
	providing a read function in the device structure is sufficient.
