2008-04-30  John Eigelaar  <jeigelaar@mweb.co.za>

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_at91sam7x512_rom.{h|ldi}: Added the 
	memory layout files to support the at91sam7x512  
	* cdl/hal_arm_at91s.cdl: Added the configuration options to 
	support the at91sam7x512
	
2008-04-23  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h: Fix setting the flash wait states
	when the clock is running faster than 60MHz. r0 was undefined 
	causing a data abort.
	
2007-03-26  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* cdl/hal_arm_at91sam7s.cdl: SAM7X and SAM7XC have a CAN bus
	controller.

2007-01-17  John Eigelaar <jeigelaar@mweb.co.za>

	* include/plf_io.h
	* src/at91sam7s_misc.c
	Added code to initialise the platform ethernet hardware if need be
	 
2007-01-02  Uwe Kindler <uwe_kindler@web.de>

	* cdl/hal_arm_at91sam7s.cdl Moved HAL_PLATFORM_XXX defines and
	definition of platform header file (CYGBLD_HAL_PLATFORM_H) from
	package CYGPKG_HAL_ARM_AT91SAM7 into board specific packages.
	
2006-06-01  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* cdl/hal_arm_at91sam7s.cdl: Implement the SPI bus 1 interface for
	the SAM7X and SAM7XC.

2006-06-01  John Eigelaar <jeigelaar@mweb.co.za>

	* include/plf_io.h: Add SPI DMA registers.

2006-05-20  John Eigelaar <jeigelaar@mweb.co.za>

	include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_at91sam7x128_rom.{h|ldi}
	include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_at91sam7x256_rom.{h|ldi}: Linker files
	for AT91SAM7X processor.
	
2006-05-17  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/at91sam7s_misc.c: Use the AT91 generic PIO manipulation
	macros. Move the LED function out into the board specific HAL
	package.

2006-04-07  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* cdl/hal_arm_at91sam7s.cdl: 
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_at91sam7s32_rom.ldi: 
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_at91sam7s64_rom.ldi: 
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_at91sam7s128_rom.ldi: 
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_at91sam7s267_rom.ldi: 
	Allow CDL to control where in flash the image is placed.

2006-03-23  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* cdl/hal_arm_at91sam7s.cdl: Implement the USB interface when chip
	has the device.
	
2006-03-10  Oliver Munz  <oli@snr.ch>

	* hal_arm_at91sam7s.cdl: Change the PLL-defaults so that 96MHz is
	generated so that the USB does work.
	
2006-03-10  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>
            Oliver Munz  <munz@speag.ch>
	
	* cdl/hal_arm_at91sam7s.cdl: Set the debug UART as the default
	channel and fix some dodge spelling.
	* src/at91sam7s_misc.c (hal_plf_hardware_init): Enable the Debug UART
	pins for output and control by the device.
	* include/plf_io.h: Define USART2 to be the debug UART.
	
2006-03-01  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* cdl/hal_arm_at91sam7s.cdl: Change the crystal frequency.  The
	numbers printed on top of the crystal are misleading. It has a
	18.432MHz crystal, not 20MHz. This error when combined with the
	previous fix to the PLL made the serial baud rate wrong.  Change
	the multiplier and divisor to achieve about the same CPU clock,
	which should be USB compatible.
	* src/at91sam7s_misc.c (hal_at91_us_baud): Need the same PLL fix
	when calculating the baud rate dynamically.
	* include/plf_io.h: Add the Programmable Clock Output registers.
	
2006-02-28  Oliver Munz <munz@speag.ch>

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h: Fix the PLL multiplier settings
	
2006-02-25  Andrew Lunn <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* misc/redboot_R[AO]M.ecm: Disable FIS and fconfig, enable
	loading directly into flash with the load command.
