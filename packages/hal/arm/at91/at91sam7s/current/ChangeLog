	* hal_arm_at91sam7s.cdl: Change the PLL-defaults so that 96MHz is
	generated so that the USB does work.

	* cdl/hal_arm_at91sam7s.cdl: Set the debug UART as the default
	channel and fix some dodge spelling.
	* src/at91sam7s_misc.c (hal_plf_hardware_init): Enable the Debug UART
	pins for output and control by the device.
	* include/plf_io.h: Define USART2 to be the debug UART.

	* cdl/hal_arm_at91sam7s.cdl: Change the crystal frequency.  The
	numbers printed on top of the crystal are misleading. It has a
	18.432MHz crystal, not 20MHz. This error when combined with the
	previous fix to the PLL made the serial baud rate wrong.  Change
	the multiplier and divisor to achieve about the same CPU clock,
	which should be USB compatible.
	* src/at91sam7s_misc.c (hal_at91_us_baud): Need the same PLL fix
	when calculating the baud rate dynamically.
	* include/plf_io.h: Add the Programmable Clock Output registers.

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h: Fix the PLL multiplier settings
	
2006-02-25  Andrew Lunn <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* misc/redboot_R[AO]M.ecm: Disable FIS and fconfig, enable
	loading directly into flash with the load command.
