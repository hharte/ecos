How to build and install the GDB module on the PID

1. Configure a minimal eCos system with all packages except 'infra' disabled.
2. Edit <hal/hal.h> to enable GDB:
    #define  CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_INCLUDE_STUBS
    #undef   CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_BREAK_SUPPORT
    #undef   CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_THREAD_SUPPORT
3. make;make -C hal/arm/pid/current/misc
4. Download the image onto the PID board:
      arm-elf-gdb -nw hal/arm/pid/current/misc/gdb_module.img
   You can connect to the board using either existing GDB stubs or Angel.
   This will download the stubs onto the board at 0x60000..0x64000
5. Configure a separate eCos system with all packages enabled.
6. make misc
7. Now download the FLASH programmer tool
      arm-elf-gdb -nw hal/arm/pid/current/misc/prog_flash
8. Run the tool.  The GDB stubs will now be programmed into the FLASH.

eCos GDB stubs should now be installed and set up as the default monitor when you
run from FLASH.
