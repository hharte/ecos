	* cdl/hal_arm_lpc2xxx.cdl: Added CYGNUM_HAL_ARM_VECTOR_0x14. That
	gives us a chance to correct a LPC2XXX program signature (ARM
	unused vector at 0x14).  The program signature is the two's
	compliment of the checksum of the ARM7 vector table. Note:
	you can quite overwrite that CDL value in your plf. startup
	code (hal_platform_setup.h).

	* src/lpc2xxx_misc.c: Fixed issue with VPBDIV initialisation on
	non lpc22xx parts code.

2006-05-08  Sergei Gavrikov  <sg@belvok.com>

	* src/lpc2xxx.misc (hal_hardware_init): Call HAL_PLF_HARDWARE_INIT
	for any platform specific initialization.

2006-05-07  Andy Jackson <andy@grapevinetech.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_arm_lpc2xxx.cdl: Added CYGHWR_HAL_ARM_LPC2XXX_FAMILY,
	CYGNUM_HAL_ARM_LPC2XXX_VPBDIV, CYGNUM_HAL_ARM_LPC2XXX_XCLKDIV
	and CYGHWR_HAL_ARM_LPC2XXX_IDLE_PWRSAVE. Changed 
	CYGHWR_HAL_ARM_LPC2XXX_EXTINT_ERRATA to a bool.
	* include/hal_var_ints.h: Removed lpc2xxx misc functions and
	added an include for lpc2xxx_misc.h to avoid breaking things.
	* include/lpc2xxx_misc.h: New header file for all the lpc2xxx
	miscellaneous functions.
	* include/var_arch.h: Made idle powerdown CDL controlled.
	* include/var_io.h: Changed to use family CDL variables.
	* src/lpc2xxx_misc.c: Changes to interrupt and VPBDIV code.

	* src/lpc2xxx_misc.c: 
	* include/plf_stub.h:

	* cdl/hal_arm_lpc2xxx.cdl: New port - based on AT91 variant.
