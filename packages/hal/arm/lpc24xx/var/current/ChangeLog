	* src/lpc2xxx_misc.c: Added hal_lpc_can_init() to initialize CAN
	channels
	* cdl/hal_arm_lpc24xx.cdl: Added a number of CYGHWR_HAL_ARM_LPC2XXX_xxx
	options for device driver compatibility reasons. Some LPC2xxx device
	drivers rely on these definitions. Moved some configuration options
	to make configuration more intuitive in configuration tool. Added
	CYGNUM_HAL_ARM_LPC2XXX_CAN_CLK option for configuration of CAN 
	peripheral clock.
	* include/var_io.h: Added macro CYGARC_HAL_LPC24XX_SET_PIN_FUN()
	* src/lpc2xxx_misc.c: Added function hal_lpc_set_pclk() to set
	peripheral clocks easily. Initialize peripheral clocks in
	hal_hardware_init() according to configuration.
