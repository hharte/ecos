2000-10-18  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/redboot_cmds.c: New file: only built in redboot, for a
	platform specific command to exec code with no MMU intervention.
	This is used to execute standard Linux kernels with as little
	change/perturbation as possible.

	* include/hal_ebsa285.h (EBSA285_RAM_BANK0_BASE): New symbol for
	redboot_cmds.c

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl: Add build redboot_cmds.c -> libextras.

2000-09-17  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl: Add platform/cpu identification strings.

2000-09-06  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl (CYGHWR_HAL_ARM_EBSA285_PCI_MEM_MAP_BASE
	CYGHWR_HAL_ARM_EBSA285_PCI_MEM_MAP_SIZE): Add strong constraints
	to the alignment and size of the PCI window by means of
	legal_values lists so that runtime can check that the MLTs opinion
	of the memory usage is valid. [This is related to CR 902624-CR,
	"MLT needs to be configuration aware"]

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_ram.h:
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_ram.ldi:

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_rom.ldi:
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_rom.mlt:
	Regenerate these from the MLT featuring a "pci_window" section in
	order to prevent the greedy heap code comsuming all of memory.
	The pci_window section is from 0xf00000 of size 0x100000
	i.e. Megabyte number 15, at the top of (default) memory.
	Unfortunately my previous quick fix (2000-08-15) for this had not
	in fact worked, because of the "clever" code which looks for
	add-in memory and consumes *that* too, unconditionally...  [This
	is related to CR 902624-CR, "MLT needs to be configuration aware"]

2000-08-18  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h: Initialize the world if you are
	blowing away previous state rather than only in ROM start.  This
	makes it possible to create a standalone RAM app that will work
	with either RedBoot in ROM or old-style GDB stubs, or any other
	loader you might find.

	Incidentally I now understand why Gary found it necessary to force
	PCI reset (2000-08-07) - with RedBoot in ROM, the RAM app was
	unconditionally reinitializing the PCI bus when it was already
	initialized, without resetting it.  We cannot play the same game
	here as with hal_platform_setup.h - I tried - because otherwise
	the net cannot re-initialize itself; the scan for devices fails.

2000-08-16  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h (CYGHWR_LED_MACRO): Use an address
	that works for a customer's own not-quite-exactly-like an EBSA
	board.  It works fine on a real EBSA too of course.
	[CASE 104355]

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_rom.h (CYGMEM_REGION_ram_SIZE):
	Do not "helpfully" consume all of memory for the heap, including
	PCI space, unconditionally; leave the PCI window alone.

2000-08-07  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/plf_io.h (HAL_PCI_INIT): Force PCI reset, just for
	good measure.

2000-08-03  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/ebsa285_misc.c (hal_delay_us): New routine, used for 
	hardware delays when no kernel timers are available.

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h (PLATFORM_SETUP1): Don't re-init
	hardware for RAM startup.  Doing so keeps network debugging from
	working (PCI gets shutdown, etc).

2000-07-25  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	CYGINT_HAL_ARM_MEM_REAL_REGION_TOP

	* src/ebsa285_misc.c (hal_arm_mem_real_region_top): Add to allow
	true memory sizes to be reported, for the benefit of dynamic memory
	systems

2000-06-19  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h: 
	'hal_dram_size' is now a properly defined variable (no more
	fixed 0x40 stuff).

2000-02-24  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/mem285.S (__mem285_init): Re-do the SDRAM initialization
	until a consistent answer is acquired twice in a row.  We have
	been seeing test failures with the SDRAM initialization in the
	board with 32Mb - the SDRAM setup is screwey; hope this fixes it.

2000-02-21  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl: Remove -mstructure-size-boundary=8
	option - no longer needed to build working network code.

2000-02-18  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl (CYGBLD_BUILD_GDB_STUBS): When
	building stubs, define every dependency required here rather than
	in the template

2000-02-10  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_cache.h (HAL_ICACHE_INVALIDATE_ALL):
	(HAL_DCACHE_INVALIDATE_ALL): Also invalidate TLBs in case the
	reason for the cache invalidate is a MM table rewrite.

2000-02-10  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/plf_stub.h:
	HAL_STUB_PLATFORM_STUBS_INIT->HAL_STUB_PLATFORM_INIT

2000-02-09  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl (CYGBLD_GLOBAL_CFLAGS): Permanently set
	the -mstructure-size-boundary=8 compilation option, as required by
	the initial version of the OpenBSD network stack port, currently
	software under development.

2000-02-07  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl: Use cpu option when linking.

2000-02-04  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

       * include/hal_platform_setup.h (INIT_XBUS_ACCESS): 
       (CYGHWR_LED_MACRO): Fix a typo - "and" alone doesn't set
       conditions, so branch depending on "PCI arbiter enabled" was taken
       randomly.

2000-02-03  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl: Implements stubs.

2000-01-31  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_ebsa285.h: Correct misleading comment.

2000-01-27  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl: Moved part of stubs build rule to
	common HAL. Changed description.

2000-01-26  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl: Removed below. Target does not have
	CygMon support.

2000-01-25  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

       * cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl: Added cygmon console device
       config. Added make rule for binary conversion of cygmon image.

2000-01-24  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl: Add stubs build rule.

2000-01-24  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/*.cdl:

	Remove obsolete option CYGTST_TESTING_IDENTIFIER.

2000-01-19  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/*.cdl: Add descriptions to a number of options &c which were
	lacking same, also tidied up other typos as noticed en passant.

2000-01-10  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/ebsa285_misc.c (hal_IRQ_handler): Conditionally remove
	debugging check for FIQ sources being active at customer's
	request; they are now using FIQ via VSR so the warning message is
	unwanted.

1999-11-25  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_diag.c: Conditionalize def of diag_buffer for only when it's
	explicitly wanted and someone hacks the code
	(hal_diag_write_char): Likewise

1999-11-25  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_rom.h:

1999-11-16  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/sdram0.cxx: New file to test SDRAM initialization.  It is
	somewhat EBSA specific in that it sanity checks the control reg
	setup as well as testing memory per se.

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl: build the new test.

	* tests/PKGconf.mak: New file: build the new test.

1999-11-16  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/mem285.S: Rewrite, essentially: it was the only way to get a
	good enough handle on what this nasty, trick stuff does.  I'm very
	happy with it now.  It's also callable for RAM startup too, to
	happily count up the RAMs as initialized: no guessing ever again!

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h: Delete some code!  Now that mem285
	initialization is sorted out, it's cool to do exactly the same
	thing for ROM and RAM startup; the mem init code differs, mind, to
	just add up the memory sizes in RAM start.

1999-11-10  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h (PLATFORM_FLUSH_DISABLE_CACHES):
	Also flush TLBs - this is vital when changing cachability &c
	during startup.  Also do that same flush in ROM start, for when we
	build to run in flash block #1 following POST executing, when
	"stuff" might be in an odd state.

1999-10-05  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* support/linux/safl_util/sa_flash.c: Add a lot of extra

	commit it.

1999-07-26  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_platform_ints.h (CYGDBG_HAL_CTRLC_ISR): Define this

	defined for platforms that do not support it.

1999-07-23  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_diag.c (hal_ctrlc_isr): Define this function, which is

	(hal_diag_write_char): Do not eat response characters from GDB:
	leave them for the ISR mentioned above to test for ^C.

	* src/ebsa285_misc.c (hal_hardware_init): Unmask the interrupt for

	sizing before the MMU is set up.  Code borrowed from CygMon/BSP of
	course.

	* src/ebsa285_misc.c: Add the meat of the 'C' initialization here;
	MMU initialization is the main addition.  Code borrowed from
	CygMon/BSP.

	* src/PKGconf.mak (COMPILE): Add mem285.S, which contains tricky
	DRAM sizing and init code - which of course can only be run from
	ROM, since it is damaging to the contents of DRAM.

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h (PLATFORM_SETUP1): Add required
	startup code in various macros to make constructing one phrase for
	ROM vs RAM startup easier, and for debug.  Code borrowed from
	CygMon/BSP.

	* src/hal_diag.c (hal_diag_init): Initialize the hardware, by
	setting the baud rate.

	* include/hal_ebsa285.h (ARM_FIRST_LEVEL_PAGE_TABLE_SIZE): Add
	this and a few other symbols for the DRAM sizing and MMU init
	code.

	* include/pkgconf/hal_arm_ebsa285.h: Typo in tidy up of config
	info.  Doh!

1999-07-16  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/hal_arm_ebsa285.h: Tidy up config info.

1999-07-15  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/ebsa285_misc.c (hal_hardware_init): Enable the caches in
	here; they are now disabled during startup.

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h (PLATFORM_SETUP1): Added code to
	disable caches [if RAM start] and switch to the ROM address
	[regardless, since it's the RAM addr if RAM start so harmless]

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_rom.ldi: Set up some of the
	values here while they are in my head; see above.

1999-07-15  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_cache.h: Tidy up cache macros and make semantics
	better match what the GDB stubs require.

1999-07-15  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/sa-110.h: removed, it was added in error.  Its contents
	live in include/hal_ebsa285.h
