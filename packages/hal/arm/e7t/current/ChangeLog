	* misc/redboot_ROM.ecm: Only read from debug port.

	* src/redboot_module.c: Fail if attempted built in wrong config.

	* src/e7t_misc.c (hal_IRQ_handler): Fixed comparisons.

2001-03-19  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/e7t_misc.c (hal_delay_us): Made it work. Not sure why the
	interrupts don't actually fire. This will probably break when that
	gets sorted out later.

	* src/hal_diag.c (cyg_hal_plf_serial_getc_nonblock): Rename a
	register.

	* src/e7t_misc.c (hal_hardware_init): Init caches, clear global
	interrupt mask flag.
	(hal_delay_us): Added.

	* include/plf_io.h: Added cache definitions.

	* include/hal_diag.h (HAL_DELAY_US): Added.

	* include/hal_cache.h: Rewrote for KS32C50100.

	* misc/redboot_ROM.ecm: Added.

	* src/redboot_module.c: Added.
	* src/gdb_module.c: Removed.

	* src/e7t_misc.c: Comment out test code, but keep it around for
	now.

	* cdl/hal_arm_e7t.cdl: Added RedBoot build magic. Removed stubs
	build magic.

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h: Set PIO directions and IO
	widths. The rest cannot be set wo hanging the board.

	* src/hal_diag.c: Baud rate is computed from 1/2 core clock. All
	register access is 32 bit. Added simple functions to print out
	values without use of RAM.
	Enabling TX/RX means allowing interrupts. Rely on vector mask only
	for controlling ctrl-c interrupts.

2001-03-16  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/e7t_misc.c: Rewrote timer and interrupt code for
	E7T. Removed reset code.

	* include/plf_io.h: Added interrupt controller and timer
	registers.

	* include/hal_platform_ints.h: Updated interrupt defintions to
	match E7T. No reset magic.

	* src/hal_diag.c: Use correct interrupt definitions.

	* Cloned from AEB HAL.
