2001-07-27  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/redboot_linux_exec.c: Fix copyright disclaimers to satisfy
	original owner (Linux kernel maintainer Russell King).

2001-07-23  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/sa11x0_misc.c (hal_IRQ_handler): Support board/platform
	specific [extended] interrupts.  On the SA11x0, these would often
	be cascaded via GPIO logic.  Use of extended macros allows SA11x0
	variant code to handle the general case, with board specific code
	defined by board packages.  Look at the iPAQ board package for
	a sample of how to use this.

2001-05-19  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/redboot_linux_exec.c (do_exec): Protect compilation - scripting
	is configurable.

2001-05-17  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_diag.c: Allow baud rate to be settable.

2001-04-16  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_sa11x0.cdl: Add CDL to describe CPU family.

2001-03-23  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/redboot_linux_exec.c (do_exec): 
	Entry point must be a physical address.

	* cdl/hal_arm_sa11x0.cdl: 
	Allow platforms to override default clock speed.

2001-03-20  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/redboot_linux_exec.c (do_exec): Improve wait timeout.

2001-03-07  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/redboot_linux_exec.c: Do not build anything if
	HAL_PLATFORM_MACHINE_TYPE is not defined.

2001-03-02  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_sa11x0.cdl: HAL_PLF_INIT stuff moved to hal/common.

2001-03-01  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/sa11x0_misc.c: 
	* cdl/hal_arm_sa11x0.cdl: New interface CYGINT_HAL_PLF_IF_INIT
	which, if defined, indicates that the platform has plf_if_init.

2001-03-01  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/sa11x0_misc.c: Remove warnings from lack of prototype for
	plf_if_init() - for platforms that don't have it.

2001-02-28  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/sa11x0_misc.c: Allow platform to perform additional
	I/O initialization (virtual vector based).  The function
	plf_if_init() can be overridden by platform code for this.

2001-02-28  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_sa11x0.h (SA11X0_TUCR_RESERVED_BITS):

	* include/hal_sa11x0.h (SA11X0_OWER): Add OS Timer Watchdog Match
	Enable Register for use by Watchdog package.
	(SA11X0_OWER_ENABLE): And a long-winded "1" to enable it.

2001-02-24  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_sa11x0.cdl: Add RedBoot commands/options.
	
	* src/redboot_linux_exec.c: New file - RedBoot commands to
	support booting Linux kernel.

2001-02-23  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_cache.h (HAL_FLASH_CACHES_OLD_MACROS): Some
	platforms use deprecated cache handling macros.

2001-02-20  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_sa11x0.cdl: Clarify CYGHWR_HAL_ARM_SA11X0_UART1,3

	* cdl/hal_arm_sa11x0.cdl: Add CDL to control which serial ports
	are available/used.

2001-02-20  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>
2001-02-12  Robin Farine  <acnrf@dial.eunet.ch>

	* include/hal_sa11x0.h (SA11X0_IRQ_GPIO_9_EDGE_DETECT): Define
	this to be 9 not 0 - simple typo.  Thanks Robin!

2001-02-19  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>
2001-02-12  Robin Farine  <acnrf@dial.eunet.ch>

	* src/sa11x0_misc.c (hal_clock_reset): Handles SA11X0_OSCR as a
	free running counter.
	(hal_clock_read): Adapts to changes in hal_clock_reset().
	(hal_delay_us): Likewise.

	There is only one counting register (OSCR), but multiple match
	registers and interrupt sources (OSMR1-OSMR3).  Setting our match
	register to COUNT and the counter register to 0 each tick makes it
	very hard to use the other match registers - whereas they are
	intended for easy general use.

	This change sets our match register OSMR0 to the next time
	interval and leaves the OSCR freerunning so that other match
	registers can easily be used, which is much more flexible, and
	much more what was intented.

	Because the OSCR is just a counter, and the match registers
	compare only for exact equality, no special measures to deal with
	the counter wrapping/overflowing are needed.

2001-02-08  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_diag.c: Replace CYGSEM_HAL_DIAG_MANGLER_None with

2001-01-26  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_diag.c: Removed CYGSEM_HAL_VIRTUAL_VECTOR_DIAG check.
	* include/plf_stub.h: Moved reset macro to
	* include/hal_var_ints.h: this file.

2001-01-05  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_mm.h: Change bitfields within memmap entry to
	unsigned, so that we can compare values successfully - otherwise
	"0x02" sign-extends and is never equal after promotion!

	* include/hal_cache.h: Include the platform memory map
	interrogation definitions from <cyg/hal/plf_mmap.h> and header for
	the new functions below.

	* src/sa11x0_misc.c (hal_virt_to_phys_address):

	platforms' hal_platform_ints.h for all the sa11x0 platforms.

	* include/hal_mm.h: New file; actually an excerpt from all the
	platforms' $PLATFORM_misc.h for all the sa11x0 platforms, which
	describes MM table layout and macros for initializing it.

2000-12-12  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_sa11x0.cdl: Allow RTC clock rate to be changable.

2000-12-04  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_cache.h: Consistently ensure that ARM registers used
	in MCR ops to cache-control coprocessors, where the data doesn't
	matter, all actually have data zero ("SBZ") as in the Jaggar book.
	This may well not be necessary, but for the sake of making sure...

2000-12-01  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_cache.h: Define addressable cache line operations
	HAL_DCACHE_STORE(), HAL_DCACHE_INVALIDATE(), HAL_DCACHE_FLUSH()
	now that I have understood how come the test (kcache2) was
	failing.  See kernel ChangeLog for details.  Also tidied up a
	couple of other minor details.

2000-11-27  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

2000-11-21  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_diag.c (init_channel): Disable broken uart setups on platforms
	other than the SA1110MM, since this code seems to be somewhat broken.

	* src/hal_diag.c: Added UART1 support for SA1100 targets.

	* include/hal_sa11x0.h: Added GPIO bit definitions.

2000-07-14  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_diag.h (HAL_DELAY_US): Define.

	* src/sa11x0_misc.c (hal_delay_us): New function.  Used to 
	provide timers/delays in non-kernel systems.

	* src/sa11x0_misc.c (hal_clock_reset): Add code to compensate for
	clock drift since this hardware does not reset on interrupts.
	(hal_clock_read): Also adjust the value returned here for same reason.

2000-06-22  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_diag.c (hal_diag_write_char):
