How to build and install the GDB module on ARM Integrator

Make GDB module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Configure and build using the 'stubs' template for the PID
target. These are the necessary CLI instructions. It can also be done
from the Configtool by selecting the appropriate templates.

 % cd /tmp
 % mkdir stubs
 % cd stubs
 % ecosconfig new integrator stubs
 % ecosconfig tree
 % make

This will install some files in ./install/bin:

 gdb_module.elf:   The built stubs image
 gdb_module.bin:   The image converted to binary (suitable for burning to ROM)
 gdb_module.img:   The relocated ELF image (suitable for FLASH writing, see below)


Prepare board for eCos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Program FLASH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The GDB module can be programmed into the begining of the user flash using an ARM debugger 
connected to the board either via Angel or Multi-ICE.
