1999-08-10  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/hal_mn10300_am32.h:
	reparent CYGPKG_HAL_MN10300_AM32 under CYGPKG_HAL_MN10300_VARIANTS

1999-07-30  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/var_intr.h: Moved HAL_INTERRUPT_CONFIGURE() here since
	it now has to be variant-specific.
	Reorganized and renumbered exceptions.
