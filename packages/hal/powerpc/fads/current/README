The FADS MPC860 board port for eCos was contributed by Kevin Hester
<khester@opticworks.com> and is partly based on the files from Motorola's
"Example Software Initializing the SMC as a UART" package (smc2.zip)
available at:
 http://www.mot.com/SPS/RISC/netcomm/tools/index.html#MPC860_table

The eCos FADS board port is provided on an "as is" basis as unsupported code.
Red Hat does not maintain this code and does not guarantee its functionality
in any way.

All inquiries about this port should be directed to the 'ecos-discuss'
mailing list (see http://sourceware.cygnus.com/ecos/intouch.html for
details).


A few comments from Kevin:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

GDB support is untested and I didn't include the GDB 'interrupt' via
the serial port support.  It would be straightforward for someone to
add this.  

You can also pass on that is was very easy to write this HAL - it only
took a day starting from the Cogent PPC HAL.

I can't promise support, but I will occasionally download from the CVS
database and run it on our card.

Usage notes:

- The startup code in fads.S assumes that the build has been downloaded by
  the mpc8bug tool included with the FADS board.  An example usage would be:
  - build a FADS build (RAM build, GDB support off)
  - link your application with the kernel you previously built
  - run the Motorola mpc8bug tool.
  - issue a mcp8bug "LOAD foo.elf" command where foo is the application you
    have linked
  - issue a mpc8bug "GO" command 
  - your program should now be running, the diag port is the upper serial
    port (SMC2)

- I haven't tried to run a "ROM" build.  The "RAM" build works great.  The
  ROM build will need to have fads.S setup more of the memory controller.

- I haven't tested the GDB interface - I have successfully run using the
  diag serial port and the example programs (such as "hello world").  GDB
  support should work, with the exception of interrupt support.

- The basic serial driver I added is based on the free Motorolla sample code
  included with the MPC860 board.  It assumes the link to the development
  station is via the SMC 2 port (the top serial port on the FADS board). This
  code in quicc_smc.c should be generalized to support any SMC port.
