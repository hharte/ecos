2000-01-26  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/plf_cache.h: Added.

1999-11-25  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_powerpc_fads_rom.h: 
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_powerpc_fads_ram.h: New file(s).

1999-09-02  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_aux.c (CYGARC_MEMDESC_TABLE): Define a non-empty table
	for the FADS board so that MM can be enabled.  I don't know why
	the ROM area is marked non-cachable, but that's as the reporter
	requested.

	As requested in PR 20270 by not-a-customer.  This is really a
	merge of that fix.

	* src/quicc_smc2.c (cyg_smc2_init): Re-order initialization so
	that RxTxBD *is* initialized before use.  Move setup of rx/tx
	params to the end of the function ie. after the data is set up.

	All as requested in PR 20271 by not-a-customer.  This is really a
	merge of that fix.

1999-06-11  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/PKGconf.mak: Build the new file.

	* src/hal_aux.c (CYGARC_MEMDESC_TABLE): New file, to define this
	object for per-platform table-driven memory map initialization.
	The table used to be in hal_misc.c in the architectural HAL; this
	is platform dependent so better and cleaner here.

1999-06-10  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/PKGconf.mak: Add quicc_smc2.c, which now lives in here;
	moved from the architectural HAL.

	* src/hal_diag.c: use local quicc_smc2.c module for IO.

	* include/plf_stub.h: use local quicc_smc2.c module for IO.

	* include/quicc_smc2.h, src/quicc_smc2.c, src/ppc_860.h: new
	files; renamed and reorganized from the architectural HAL.
	
1999-05-20  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/hal_powerpc_fads.h: Move RTC setup here.

1999-04-08  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/*.ldi: Revised SECTION_* macro arguments to
	avoid padded output sections (PR 19787)

1999-03-23  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_diag.c: Disable interrupts when doing diag output so that
	system "freezes" while this goes on

1999-03-04  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/*.ldi: give all LDI files unique names so
        that they can co-exist in an eCos build tree (PR 19184)
	* include/pkgconf/*.mlt: give all MLT files unique names so
        that they can co-exist in an eCos build tree (PR 19184)

1999-02-16  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>
	
	* src/hal_diag.c (hal_diag_write_char): Changed
	__output_gdb_string to hal_output_gdb_string.

	* include/plf_stub.h: [added]
	* src/hal_stub.c:     [removed]
	* src/PKGconf.mak: 
	Changed hal_stub to plf_stub. Moved generic HAL stub code to
	common/.../hal_stub.c.

1999-02-08  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	CDL. Fixed inconsistency with usage notes.
