1999-05-27  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S:
	Move call to hal_diag_intr_start to a more useful place.
	Added a save of the current state pointer to memory for ctrl-c
	support. Ensure that exceptions are enabled before calling the ISR
	to allow breakpoints to function.

	* src/mips-stub.c: Imported asynchronous interrupt support from
	libstub/cygmon.

	* include/hal_intr.h: Added HAL_DEFAULT_ISR to contain the name of

	Also fixed some typos in some macros.

1999-05-21  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_intr.h: Define HAL_INTERRUPT_STACK_BASE and
	HAL_INTERRUPT_STACK_TOP so that stack usage macros in
	kernel/.../stackmon.hxx can work.

	* src/vectors.S (cyg_interrupt_stack_base): Define this symbol for
	the interrupt stack and its friend for the stack top so that we
	can publish them with nice names.

1999-05-21  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S: 
	Rationalized use of "at" and "noat" setting.
	Made use of "lar" where necessary.

1999-05-13  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>
	The following have been merged from a branch:
	
    1999-05-11  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_arch.h: 
	* include/hal_intr.h: 
	* include/hal_cache.h: 
	* include/arch.inc:
	Changed references to "imp" and "implementation" to "var" and
	"variant" respectively. These are better names for these files and
	functions.

	* src/vectors.S: 
	Removed or disabled some development/debug code.
	Same imp->var changes as above.
	
    1999-05-06  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S: Added call to hal_cpu_except_enable in
	__default_exception_vsr to re-enable nested exceptions.

	* src/mips-stub.c: Use _registers[X] rather that register[X] for
	accessing CPU registers, since the former may point to per-thread
	register sets while the latter only refers to the current trap
	register set.

	* include/arch.inc: Added hal_cpu_except_enable macro to
	(re-)enable exception processing and disable interrupts. This is
	necessary if we are to allow nested exceptions (like breakpoints
	in exception handlers).

    1999-04-29  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S: Reenable interrupts while processing exceptions.
	Several temporary kludges to permit us to test ROM code from RAM
	under PMON.

	* include/mips.inc: Extended list of CP0 register aliases.

	
	* include/arch.inc: Added generic version of hal_cache_init to
	disable kseg0 caching in config0 register.

	* include/hal_cache.h: Moved dummy addresses used in index
	operations to 0x80000000, zero caused MMU exceptions.
	Fixed looping bugs in all macros that use them.

    1999-04-23  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S: Added support for floating point register save
	and restore. Fixed hal_interrupt_stack_call_pending_DSRs to use
	hal_cpu_int_merge macro.

	* src/context.S: Added support for floating point register save
	and restore. Started some preparations for 64 bit processor
	support.

	* include/mips.inc: Added floating point register aliases. Moved
	saved state to arch.inc.

	* include/hal_arch.h: Completed support for floating point state
	save and restore. Parameterized GDB support macros a little to
	enable GDB to work properly.

	* include/arch.inc: Added support for floating point state save
	and restore. Moved assembler version of saved state layout here
	from mips.inc.

    1999-04-22  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/context.S (hal_thread_load_context): Substituted explicit
	code to reload the interrupt enable state with a macro.

	* include/hal_cache.h: Removed default implementations of
	HAL_[D/I]CACHE_[EN/DIS]ABLE since these were actually TX39
	specific. There is aparrently no standard way of implementing
	these function in the MIPS architecture.

	* include/mips.inc: Added a comment to point out a TX39-only
	register.
	
	* src/vectors.S: Modified hal_interrupt_stack_call_pending_DSRs()
	to also call DSRs with interrupts enabled. Returns interrupt state
	to original value when finished.
	Use hal_cpu_int_ensable macro in place of explicit code in
	hal_interrupt_stack_call_pending_DSRs().

    1999-04-21  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/arch.inc: Ifdeffed definition of hal_intc_init macro to
	allow it to be defined elsewhere. Added default versions of diag
	macros.

	* src/vectors.S: Added some low-level diagnostic macros to show
	HAL events if there is adequate hardware (such as leds).
	Removed interrupt enable/disables in interrupt processing since we
	can now go through a thread switch with interrupts disabled.
	Ifdeffed ISR tables so they can be defined elsewhere.
	Added implementation of hal_interrupt_stack_call_pending_DSRs.
	Added calls to implementation and platform init routines.
	
	* src/hal_misc.c: Many changes to hal_idle_thread_action() to
	print or instrument various CPU registers. Left with code to
	wiggle an led in the idle loop.
	Stripped out TX39 specific code and moved it to plf_misc.c.
	
	* src/context.S: Added code to save and restore the interrupt mask
	state in thread contexts.

	* include/hal_intr.h:
	Renamed default interrupts to match the hardware more closely.
	Added ifdef around HAL_TRANSLATE_VECTOR() so it can be made
	platform/variant specific. Added implementation of
	HAL_INTERRUPT_ACKNOWLEDGE().

	* include/hal_arch.h (HAL_THREAD_INIT_CONTEXT): Aligned the
	intitial stack pointer to 16 byte boundary, added an initial value
	for the status register.

	* include/arch.inc: Added some nops to eret macros.

    1999-04-13  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/mips.ld: Migrate global MIPS linker script to individual
	MIPS variant directories

1999-04-30  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

    1999-04-30  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@masala.cygnus.co.uk>
	* src/hal_misc.c (hal_init_ctrlc_intr): Chain onto the old value
	of the ISR when attaching the ctrl-c ISR; this allows chained
	interrupts to work (otherwise a stack-wrecking interrupt loop
	occurs).
    1999-04-29  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>
	* include/pkgconf/hal_tx39.h (CYGDBG_HAL_MIPS_INSTALL_CTRL_C_ISR): 
	New config option, on by default.
	* src/hal_misc.c (hal_ctrlc_isr): Enable these features on
	CYGDBG_HAL_MIPS_INSTALL_CTRL_C_ISR new config option.

1999-04-28  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/PKGconf.mak:
	Remove the -n argument to tail, it does not appear to be required
	on any supported host and causes problems with some
	implementations of tail.

1999-04-20  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_intr.h: Don't sync TRR if platform sim - it doesn't need
	it

	* include/pkgconf/hal_tx39.h: 
	Allow CYGARC_TX39_PR19846 to override

	sensible in the simulators
	
	Related to PR 19846

1999-04-15  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/tx39.ld: Define __bss_end at the end of the BSS

	necessary
	Related fix to that of PR19642

1999-04-14  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/PKGconf.mak (EXTRAS): Don't generate extras.o here any more

	Also moved address used in HAL_DCACHE_INVALIDATE_ALL() to
	0x9fc00000, which is the cached ROM space.

1999-03-24  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S:
	Added options to allow different settings for DRAM initialization.
	Fixed some ifdef bugs.

	done in the serial driver. Added cyg_hal_is_break() and
	cyg_hal_user_break() to detect and provoke ^C processing. These

1999-02-23  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	pointer to the saved CPU state.
	
	* src/vectors.S:
	Added support for 66MHz part (untested).
	Added support for SIGINT-causing magic breakpoint to allow

	* src/mips.ld:
	Provide alternate definition of macro SECTION_rom_vectors() for

	Use CYGDBG_INFRA_DIAG_USE_DEVICE (from infra.h) instead of
	CYG_DIAG_USE_DEVICE (badly named, from kernel.h).

1998-09-01  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_intr.h:

	Updated for new kernel configuration option symbol names

Fri Aug 28 10:01:24 1998  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_misc.c:
	Rename __main() to cyg_hal_invoke_constructors() to prevent the
	implied link with things called, or related to main(). Remove static
	initialised variable as we can now guarantee it is only called
	once.

	* src/vectors.S:
	Instead of calling main(), call cyg_start() which lives in the infra
	package.
	Explicitly invoke constructors as it isn't done magically for us
	any more, now that main() is no longer used.

	* src/vectors.S:
	Now pass pointer to saved registers as third argument to
	interrupt_end().
