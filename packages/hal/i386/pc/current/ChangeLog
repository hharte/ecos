	HAL_INTERRUPT_ATTACH() to prevent compiler errors.

	using SCREEN diagnostics. This is as much for completeness and
	future use than for any pressing current need.

	* include/platform.inc: Fixed some mismatches between instruction
	suffixes and operand sizes that the latest i386 assembler now
	warns about. Also tidied up GDT and IDT load code and protected

2000-03-09  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/platform.inc:
	* cdl/hal_i386_pc.cdl: Rename CYGHWR_HAL_STARTUP to

	* src/plf_stub.c (cyg_hal_gdb_isr): Added check for a character
	being available at the serial line. With the introduction of GDB O
	packet debugging, it is possible for this code to see a spurious
	interrupt and get stuck in hal_pc_get_char().

	* include/var_intr.h:
	Modified interrupt enable/disable code so that it is closer in
	behavior to other HALs.

	* include/platform.inc:
	Changed floppy bootstrap code so it can load binaries greater than
	64k and only loads the .text+.data parts, not the .bss.

2000-02-18  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_i386_pc.cdl (CYGBLD_BUILD_GDB_STUBS): When
