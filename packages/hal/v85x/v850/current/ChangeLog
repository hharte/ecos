	* cdl/hal_v85x_v850.cdl: Separate v850_ice.cxx into separate file
	and only build if CYGDBG_HAL_V850_ICE. Also only build for ROM
	or ROMRAM startup.
	* src/hal_diag.c: msec_timeout can be static
	* src/v850_stub.c: Separate ICE support into new v850_ice.cxx file from
	here
	* src/v850_ice.cxx: New file
	* src/v85x_v850.ld: Enter at reset_vector for ROM or ROMRAM startup.
	This is better when loading via ICE.

2001-03-29  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_v85x_v850.cdl: Fix typo.

2001-03-28  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_diag.c: Move here from platform HALs - on-board serial0
	is generic for V850 platforms.

	* cdl/hal_v85x_v850.cdl: Build hal_diag.c
	Add interfaces indicating variant.
	Add option for ICE debugging.

	* include/v850_common.h: Move register definitions here from
	platform HAL and define both SA1 and SB1 variants.
	Also rename some to match official docs.

	* include/var_arch.h: No need to include <pkgconf/hal.h>

	* include/var_cache.h: Provide empty default cache macros here.

	* include/var_intr.h: Move interrupt definitions here from
	platform HAL and define for both SA1 and SB1 variants.
	Also rename some to match official docs.

	* src/v850_misc.c: Doesn't use tracing, so don't include header.

	* src/v850_stub.c: Reflect CYGNUM_HAL_VECTOR_WATCHDOG_TIMER ->
	CYGNUM_HAL_VECTOR_INTWDT renaming.
	Add support for debugging via ICE and gdbserv.

	* src/v85x_v850.ld: Start at "start" not "reset_vector".
	Support ram_vectors section (separated out to support ROMRAM startup).

	* src/nec.ld: Remove - redundant.

	* tests/nmitest.c: Added. Standalone test for checking if we've
	received an NMI.

2000-09-06  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_v85x_v850.cdl: Improve [CPU] variant support.

2000-07-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* src/v850_stub.c (__is_breakpoint_function): Removed use
	of CYG_LABEL_NAME() and added underscore to _breakinst.

	* src/nec.ld, src/v85x_v850.ld:
	Switched to new table definition mechanism.

2000-06-12  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/v850_misc.c (hal_interrupt_unmask): Remove [extra]
	debug message.

2000-06-09  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/v850_misc.c: Make interrupt handling routines safe.
	Also add asserts to verify.

2000-05-25  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/v85x_v850.ld: Add platform specifics.  In particular the
	special, hardwired symbol "hal_vsr_table" needs to be platform
	specific.

2000-05-24  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/v850_common.h: Split into platform specific files.

2000-04-25  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/v85x_v850.ld: Fix linking problem with "_etext".

2000-04-14  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/v850_stub.c: Use 'br *' with a watchdog to emulate a
	breakpoint since the hardware does not support them directly.

2000-04-11  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/v850_stub.c (next_pc): Instruction "jmp [Rn]" was being
	decoded incorrectly, leading to erroneous single step behaviour.

2000-03-31  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/context.S: Use SLD/SST for smaller, faster code in context
	save/restore functions.

2000-03-30  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/context.S (_hal_longjmp): 
	(_hal_setjmp): Need to save R1/R2/R4/R5 since GCC seems to use them.

2000-03-27  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/var_intr.h: Remove extra junk left over from cut&paste.

	* src/context.S: Add setjmp/longjmp support.

2000-03-21  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/v850_stub.c (__skipinst): Use single step code properly.

2000-03-20  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/v850_stub.c: Add single step support.
