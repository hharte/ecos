# Purpose:      HTML files generated from DocBook sources using the nwalsh
#               stylesheets have a number of problems. Most importantly,
#               Netscape 4.x does not understand all of the character entities
#               defined by HTML 4.0x

# Find out the current year for the copyright message. Ideally
# this would be a range extracted from the sources, but that is
# a little bit tricky.

# The generated files all have a .htm suffix rather than a .html
# suffix. For now this is preserved, to avoid having to change all the
# anchors. It might be better to rename all the files to .html in
# future, and perhaps also to change book1.htm to index.htm
