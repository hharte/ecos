** Host side platforms

*** These are the eCos 1.2.1 platforms....
**** Redhat Linux 4.2 and later
**** Solaris 2.5.1 and later
**** Windows NT 4.0SP3 and later
**** Windows 95/98 (Beta)

*** These are the new host platforms...

**** None yet

** Host tool features

**** None yet

** Drivers
*** Watchdog Drivers added for:
     Sharp LH77790 (ARM7DI core) - ARM AEB-1 board

** New toolchain features

** API additions

*** PCI library - providing an API to control the PCI buses of supported targets

*** Debugging
	The file <cyg/kernel/test/stackmon.h> defines some functions
	that can be used to profile stack usage.

** API changes

*** Kernel

**** KAPI
	include/kapi.h (cyg_thread_delete): is now a boolean function to
	indicate success.  Failure is when the thread needs to run in
	order to become killed.

** ISO C library

** HAL changes

*** i386/linux
	The eCos idle loop will not load the host system anymore
	(except in special configurations, see linux_misc.c).

*** Sparclite

Where supported by the targetted platform, it is now possible to use
Multiple Vector Trapping (MVT).

*** Common

** Other new features
