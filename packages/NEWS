* Hitachi SH7709A variant support added
* NEC V85x architecture support added
* NEC Cosmo CEB-V850/SA1 evaluation board platform HAL added
* Serial device drivers added for systems based on NEC V850 SA1 (70F3017)
  or SB1 (70F3033) processors
* Hitachi SH3 CqREEK (cq7708) platform HAL support added
  Contributed by Haruki Kashiwaya [Still untested, serial not imported]
* Watchdog reworked much like wallclock.
  Common code and API in io/watchdog, simpler (smaller) low-level drivers in
  devs/watchdog/<arch>.
* IO serial driver
  The common serial driver has been extended with a configurable option for
  a non-blocking read/write mode. It has also been given some new callbacks
  which allow low-level drivers to transfer data in blocks instead of as
  single characters.
* SH HAL
  Now provides ROMRAM startup type, copying code and data to RAM before
  executing, improving performance at cost of memory.
* IO serial drivers reworked by separating into distinct platform
  packages, making it simpler to implement new drivers.
* WallClock reworked, making it simpler to implement new drivers.
  New drivers
  o SH3 RTC module

-------- eCos 1.3.1 public net release:

* New architectures and variants
  o ARM Thumb
  o ARM9
  o Hitachi SH3
  o Cirrus Logic CL-PS7111, EP72xx
  o Intel StrongARM
  o Matsushita AM33
  o NEC MIPS VR4300

* New platforms
  o ARM AEB-1 rev C
  o ARM PID support extended: ARM9, Thumb and big-endian
  o Cirrus Logic EDB7xxx
  o Cogent CMA222 and CMA230 ARM boards. (CMA222 contributed by Mark Salter)
  o Hitachi EDK7708
  o Intel x86 PC (base port contributed by Patrick O'Grady)
  o Intel EBSA285
  o Matsushita STB
  o Motorola MBX evaluation board
  o NEC VRC4373

* New hosts
  o Windows 2000 host support (beta)
  o Red Hat Linux 6.x (should work on other distributions, but only
    Red Hat Linux 6.x has been used for testing).

* Configuration system revised
  o Tools based on GPL'd configuration library (only tested on
    Windows and Red Hat Linux 6.x)
  o Tools available for both Windows (graphical) and Linux (CLI).
  o Target side configuration much more flexible now, even though
    existing configuration data has not yet been changed to take full
    advantage of the new features.

* TCP/IP stack and drivers [distributed in separate package]
  o OpenBSD based, supporting UDP, TCP and ICMP.
  o Motorola MBX (quicc) driver.
  o Cirrus Logic EDB7xxx driver.

* PCI bus library
  o Simple API for configuring PCI resources.
  o Intel EBSA285 HAL implementation.
  o NEC VRC4373 HAL implementation.

* New watchdog drivers
  o ARM AEB-1
  o Hitachi EDK7708
  o Intel EBSA285

* Debugging
  o Stack monitoring
    The file <cyg/kernel/test/stackmon.h> defines some functions
    that can be used to profile stack usage.

* API changes
  o KAPI
    include/kapi.h (cyg_thread_delete): is now a boolean function to
    indicate success.  Failure is when the thread needs to run in
    order to become killed.

* HAL changes
  o i386/linux
    The eCos idle loop will not load the host system anymore (except
    in special configurations, see linux_misc.c).
  o MIPS
    Split into arch/variant/platform hierarchy.
  o MN10300
    Split into arch/variant/platform hierarchy.
  o PowerPC
    Split into arch/variant/platform hierarchy.
    Major revamp of exception handling - _not_ backwards compatible
    (see vectors.S for the reasoning behind the change).
  o SPARClite
    Where supported by the targetted platform, it is now possible to
    use Multiple Vector Trapping (MVT).

* CygMon
  o Integration of CygMon ROM monitor into eCos by porting it on top
    of the eCos HAL
